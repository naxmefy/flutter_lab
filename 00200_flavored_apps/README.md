# flavored

testing https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_flavorizr

## what i do not like

- the extensions seems to be a one time usage (should be executed once)
- multiple executions are working (barly tested)
- launch icons and splashscreen currently only from dummy assets - possibility to setup own assets.zip but is a general approach and not per flavor
- linting error for prefined app entry (can not be modified)

## what i could else try

- [ ] flutter_lanuncher_icons but does it work for ios schemes?
- [ ] flutter_native_splashscreens (is it flavored?)
